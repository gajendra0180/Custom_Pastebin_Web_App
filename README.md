Hey Friends,you might be familiar with pastebin and hastebin web apps and might have used one as well.I have made a Web App similar to the hastebin application but it is  a lighter version of the same.
Used Node JS, express JS with EJS templating Engine for backend, cdnjs highlight.js library for Syntax highlighting with language autodetection,mongoose and mongodb for Database.
